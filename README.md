Instructor : prof.JangWoo Kim


My space for Projects

1. ALU : 16-bit ALU
2. RTL sequential logic

    2-1) 010 detector
  
    2-2) Register File

3. Vending machine : RTL Design
4. 16-bit single cycle CPU
5. 16-bit multi cycle CPU
6. 16-bit pipeline CPU

    6-1) pipeline CPU with stall for data hazard solution
    
    6-2) pipeline CPU with forwarding for data hazard solution
    
    6-3) pipeline CPU with branch predictor for control hazard solution

7. 16-bit pipeline CPU with cache

    7-1) baseline CPU - it takes 2-cycle to read memory
    
    7-2) cache CPU - it takes 6-cycle to read memory and 1-cycle to read cache
